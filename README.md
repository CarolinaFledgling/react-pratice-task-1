# Simply React app

In that small project I wanted to practice all these core patterns and concepts that are important for React,
like components, props, state, lifting state, stylingâ€¦


- where we create a bunch of reused components, ğŸš€
- where they have small isolated pieces of HTML code and logic ğŸš€
- where every component really has its own task ğŸš€

## Focusing on :

- Practicing building reused components ğŸš€
- Showing Error Modal ğŸš€
- Conditional Loading Message ğŸš€
- Handling added and delete user form in the list ğŸš€

## Run Locally

Clone the project

```bash
  https://github.com/CarolinaFledgling/react-pratice-task-1.git
```

```bash
npm install

npm run start
# or
yarn start

```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
