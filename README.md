# Simply React app

In that small project I wanted to practice all these core patterns and concepts that are important for React,
like components, props, state, lifting state, stylingâ€¦


- where we create a bunch of reused components, ðŸš€
- where they have small isolated pieces of HTML code and logic ðŸš€
- where every component really has its own task ðŸš€

## Focusing on :

- Practicing building reused components ðŸš€
- Showing Error Modal ðŸš€
- Conditional Loading Message ðŸš€
- Handling added and delete user form in the list ðŸš€
- Implementing modal using React Portal approach. 

## What I learned :

My first approach with implementing Modal as a overlay on the page,
being rendered to the DOM was not ideal idea, because:

- is not a good structure, not good practice
- if you have such nested overlay content can lead to real problem with styling or with accessibility
- screen reader has to interpret your HTML code which is being rendered

To improve that approach I learned about Portal. 
Portals need two things.

1. You need a place you wanna port the Component to 
2. You need to let the Component know that it should have a portal to that place.

## Run Locally
