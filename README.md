# Simply React app

In that small project I wanted to practice all these core patterns and concepts that are important for React,
like components, props, state, lifting state, styling…

## The main idea of working with React :

- where we create a bunch of reused components, 🚀
- where they have small isolated pieces of HTML code and logic 🚀
- where every component really has its own task 🚀

## Focusing on :

- Practicing building reused components 🚀
- Showing Error Modal 🚀
- Conditional Loading Message 🚀
- Handling added and delete user form the list 🚀

## Run Locally

Clone the project

```bash
  https://github.com/CarolinaFledgling/react-pratice-task-1.git
```

```bash
npm install

npm run start
# or
yarn start

```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
